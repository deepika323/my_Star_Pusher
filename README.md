This game is about moving stars to some predifined goals. In this player can move up,down,left and right until its path is blocked by some obstacle.
Since this is a group project and work is divided among the members,so my part includes methods startScreen,readLevelsFile and floodFill.
startScreen method displays the start screen of the game Star Pusher.
readLevelsFile method reads the text file that contains levels of the game.It distinguishes and identifies each level and stores each level object in levels list.
floodFill is a recursive method.In this game, the flood fill algorithm creates the inside/outside floor distinction.
